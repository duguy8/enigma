The sky took its cue, every color and hue on display
Till thick veils of indigo signaled the end of the day
But each landscape that lies in the mirror of your eyes turns to grey
You're here but it's clear
You're just salt and shadow
Here but half a world away
You're here but you're merely a hologram
So near but still so far away
