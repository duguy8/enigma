Territorial organisms
Each glorifying our poor decisions
I'm a force, you could forecast swarming insects
Who eat all the corn like war is business
I pageant wave from my shallow grave
Patch me in from that astral plane
Ain't ring the bell, I pass through the walls
A cool burgundy in both tooth and claw
Midnight manage an incredible feat
A GPS collar on the neck of the beast
It go, beep-beep, any neck of the reef
Put a reaper on a second week of medical leave
I'm a seer, I could tell you how the curtain descend
Or maybe hint at how it isn't with a circle of friends
I go bah with the black sheep, rah rah, catch me a patsy
Spaz, unravel, and blaspheme
Riddler to keep the gate
It's a groundhog D-Day, Jesus H
I was born on a horse at a steeplechase
My forte's frontline real estate
Plus steak and frites, I take bloody as hell
If it burn black, point him at the honey and milk
I ain't sitting while you sully the well
I turn up in a jiff, jackknife when I jump in the pit
One hundred hands, one million eyes
Two bleeding gums, I will survive
That last line's rose-colored only for a limited time
It all shifts when you militarize
I had a vision of a feather on a seasonal wind
In the shadow of a gargoyle fleeing the brick
Lean in, steal your chips
Where I'm from, y'all wouldn't even be in the mix
